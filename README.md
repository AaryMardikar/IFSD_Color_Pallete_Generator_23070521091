🧠 Project Overview

The IFSD Color Palette Generator is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack.
It enables users—especially designers, developers, and artists—to easily generate, customize, and store color palettes for creative projects.

The project integrates user authentication, interactive UI components, and persistent database storage.
Users can register or log in securely, generate random color palettes, adjust colors through a color picker, and save their palettes to MongoDB for later use.

This project demonstrates key aspects of full-stack development such as:

RESTful API design with Express.js

State management and routing in React

Secure authentication using JWT

Persistent data storage in MongoDB

Frontend–backend communication via Axios

It’s designed as a part of the Integrated Full Stack Development (IFSD) coursework, highlighting end-to-end web application development skills.
